            <h4>A website that showcases the electric consumption and cost in New York City, within the month of January&nbsp;2023, using a public API owned by <a href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us">NYC&nbsp;open&nbsp;data&nbsp;website.</a></h4>

            <h5>Each building represents the <i>five boroughs</i> in New York City, and each specific window represents the summation of "current charges" and "other charges", to create a total charge of electric consumption of each data entry. 
                The scaling up of the window depends on the amount of the total cost generated. The background color of each window is based on where the value falls in the bracket of the total amount of consumption, summation of two consumption data points, for&nbsp;each&nbsp;data&nbsp;entry.</h5>
